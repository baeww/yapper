To make this a fully functional app, you would need to:

1. Implement user authentication and follow/unfollow functionality.
2. Set up a backend API to handle daily prompt generation, audio upload, and fetching responses from followed users.
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states.
4. Add more features like user profiles, notifications, and response comments.
